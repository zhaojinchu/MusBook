* Fix formating

// TODO: Make sure that only students and teachers that have connected can message each other

// TODO: Create notifications for all events that should have them

// TODO: Add validation to assignment creation form - disallow a due date in the past

// TODO: Check up on lesson request forms. Recurring lesson request need ironing out. Better to have duration, day, perhaps some other variables.

// TODO: Fix up request lesson form:
* Put JS so recurring amount only appears after is recurring is selected
* Duration should be amount of hours, not a time field
* Fix formating

// TODO: FOR THE VERY END - fix all formating and frontend styling

// TODO: Make sure that only students and teachers that have connected can message each other

// TODO: Create notifications for all events that should have them

// TODO: Add validation to assignment creation form - disallow a due date in the past

// TODO: Check up on lesson request forms. Recurring lesson request need ironing out. Better to have duration, day, perhaps some other variables.

// BUG: Students can message teachers that are still on pending connection requests. Only after they have connected can they message

// BUG: Calendar is not public calendar. Only events for the student, or event for the teacher should be seen by the respective user
